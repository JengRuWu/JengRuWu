## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jeng-Ru, a Software Engineer @ Amazon

I'm a software engineer at Amazon specializing in email security. During my internship at Amazon, I designed a scalable spam trap system that collects spam to train an in-house classifier. 

I hold a Master's degree in computer science from UPenn, with coursework in distributed systems, programming language theory, computer graphics, and network security.
